## **What is AWS?**
---
Amazon Web Services (AWS) is the world’s most comprehensive and broadly adopted cloud platform, offering over 200 fully featured services from data centers globally. Millions of customers—including the fastest-growing startups, largest enterprises, and leading government agencies—are using AWS to lower costs, become more agile, and innovate faster.

## **What are thhe benefits?**
---
- **User-friendly**

This tops the list of the Amazon Web Services benefits. AWS is easy to use as the platform is specially designed for quick and secure access.

- **Flexible** 

Flexibility is also the reason why many companies prefer AWS. It always lets you use those operating systems, programming languages, and web application platforms that you are comfortable with.

- **Secure** 

Security is one of the best benefits of AWS cloud computing. As we know, security is the uppermost priority for any company that is data-driven.

- **Cost-effective** 

If you follow traditional methods, then you should build your own servers for storing your data and applications, which consumes a good amount of both your time and money.

- **Reliable** 

Amazon offers the highest reliability for its customers. AWS serves over a million active clients in more than 200 nations all over the world.

- **Scalable and Elastic** 

AWS is scalable because the AWS Auto Scaling service automatically increases the capacity of constrained resources as per requirements so that the application is always available.

### **Choosing the right infrastructure**

There are different factors to take into account when deciding which service to use to deploy your first web application on the AWS Cloud. You should consider if you want a managed infrastructure with low stress, if you need containers (and why) or if you want full control and customization. Let's get started!

### Write code and deploy automatically, AWS takes care of the infrastruction
---
- Integrate with CD, build and deploy automatically. Never worry about configuration of the underlying services
- Use vanilla JavaScript, or any JS framework, or write your own code with Java, .NET, Go, Ruby, PHP, and Python
- An easy and quick way to deploy

### **Build and deploy using containers**
---
- Build and deploy a website using cloud native technologies such as Docker and Kubernetes
- Fully managed infrastructure with lightweight and global scalability options available
- Easiest and fastest way to deploy a web application with containers

### **Build and deploy on a virtual machine**
---
- Highest level of control of the complete technology stack
- Full support of the underlying operating system plus custom configurations
- Easiest conversion from on-premise virtual machines to cloud
