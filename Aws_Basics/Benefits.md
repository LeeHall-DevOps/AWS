- **User-friendly**

This tops the list of the Amazon Web Services benefits. AWS is easy to use as the platform is specially designed for quick and secure access.

- **Flexible** 

Flexibility is also the reason why many companies prefer AWS. It always lets you use those operating systems, programming languages, and web application platforms that you are comfortable with.

- **Secure** 

Security is one of the best benefits of AWS cloud computing. As we know, security is the uppermost priority for any company that is data-driven.

- **Cost-effective** 

If you follow traditional methods, then you should build your own servers for storing your data and applications, which consumes a good amount of both your time and money.

- **Reliable** 

Amazon offers the highest reliability for its customers. AWS serves over a million active clients in more than 200 nations all over the world.

- **Scalable and Elastic** 

AWS is scalable because the AWS Auto Scaling service automatically increases the capacity of constrained resources as per requirements so that the application is always available.

- **Highly Performant** 

High-performance computing (HPC) is the ability to process a massive amount of data at high speed.
