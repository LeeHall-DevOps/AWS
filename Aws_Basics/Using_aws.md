### **Choosing the right infrastructure**

There are different factors to take into account when deciding which service to use to deploy your first web application on the AWS Cloud. You should consider if you want a managed infrastructure with low stress, if you need containers (and why) or if you want full control and customization. Let's get started!

### Write code and deploy automatically, AWS takes care of the infrastruction
---
- Integrate with CD, build and deploy automatically. Never worry about configuration of the underlying services
- Use vanilla JavaScript, or any JS framework, or write your own code with Java, .NET, Go, Ruby, PHP, and Python
- An easy and quick way to deploy

### **Build and deploy using containers**
---
- Build and deploy a website using cloud native technologies such as Docker and Kubernetes
- Fully managed infrastructure with lightweight and global scalability options available
- Easiest and fastest way to deploy a web application with containers

### **Build and deploy on a virtual machine**
---
- Highest level of control of the complete technology stack
- Full support of the underlying operating system plus custom configurations
- Easiest conversion from on-premise virtual machines to cloud
